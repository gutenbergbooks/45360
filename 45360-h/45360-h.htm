<h2>WINTER COVENT GARDEN OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/193a-300.png"><img src="images/193a-150.png" width="150" height="281" alt="WINTER COVENT GARDEN OPERATIC NOTES" /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">Sir Augustus Anglo-Operaticus</span> has done well at Covent Garden,
and will probably go one better. To Miss <span class="sc">Alice Esty</span>, as <i>Elsa</i>, in
<i>Lohengrin</i>, we say "<i>Esty perpetua</i>." All are good: and the houses
have been apparently as good as the company.
A season of German-French-Italian Opera in
English is a risky venture for a winter season;
still, if successful, and at popular prices, there
is in it good promise for the future. The conductors
are Messrs. <span class="sc">Feld</span>, <span class="sc">Henschel</span>, <span class="sc">Glover</span>,
and Mr. <span class="sc">C. Hedmondt</span>, which sounds like an
English rendering of <i>Tête Monté</i>. A <i>Tête
Monté</i> can carry many a project through
triumphantly where a <i>Tête moins Monté</i>
would fail.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Excellent <i>Faust</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Philip
Brozel</span>, first time in English, decidedly good.
Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> thought the old opera
"wanted a fillip," and so gave us <span class="sc">Philip
Brozel</span>. <span class="sc">Kate Lee</span> a capital nurse, and <span class="sc">Fanny
Moody</span> a delightful <i>Marguerite</i>. <span class="sc">Olitzka</span> a
pleasing <i>Siebel</i>, and conductor <span class="sc">Glover</span>, as his
name implies, keeping all hands well employed,
and ready to give fits to any hand that might be "difficult." The
remainder of the week "going strong."</p>

<p>In the interests of English opera, or rather of opera in English,
we wish <span class="sc">Druriolanus Covent Gardensis Operaticus</span>, with
<i>Messieurs Tête Monté et Cie.</i>, every possible success.</p>

<h2>THE AMNESIA BACILLUS.</h2>

<p>IT was an alarming state of affairs. The first indications of the
new epidemic were noticed in the autumn of 1895. A lady who
mislaid her identity at Brighton, and failed to recover it for a whole
week, had the doubtful distinction of being the initial case. Her
example was very shortly after followed by a servant-girl who "lost
her memory" at Three Bridges Railway Station. Not being
properly labelled, there was naturally some delay before she was
returned to her supperless and sorrowing mistress. Then the plague
spread.</p>

<p>Among the first to suffer were the numerous class of persons who
had been so unfortunate as to borrow money. The simple operation
of transferring a half-crown or a fiver seemed to carry contagion
with it. From the instant that the fatal coin was in the palm of the
innocent and unsuspecting borrower, all recollection of his previous
personality vanished. The unhappy victim had no resource but to
start life afresh as he best could, with new struggles to face, new
lenders thus to victimise him&mdash;and new capital (a paltry equivalent!)
wherewith to mourn his hopeless loss of memory. It was
observed that these sufferers were subject to recurrent attacks of the
<i>amnesia bacillus</i>. Some scientific alienists went so far as to maintain
that the complaint was no new one, but had been prevalent, in
a more or less virulent form, ever since the first leather coinage was
invented.</p>

<p>The Woman with a Past was the next to succumb. She was not
quite so much <i>en évidence</i> as in the two or three previous years;
still, a considerable number of her carried on a contented, if obscure
and occasionally chequered, existence. She only rarely imitated the
<i>Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i> in putting a violent end to her career.
Then all at once she, too, caught the disease. All the romance fled
out of her life, all the deep insight into masculine character, all the
love-souvenirs, so interesting to herself&mdash;and to her female acquaintances.
(<i>They</i> did not forget any of these entertaining details, however.)
But as far as she was concerned, her Past completely
vanished, and, poor thing, like the half-crown borrower, she had to
begin all over again. It was weary work, converting her future into
a Past, or series of Pasts, and if she frequently failed in her task, we
must put it down to the deadly and character-destroying bacillus.</p>

<p>Then the New Women took it severely, and quite forgot themselves.
However, they have been so completely advertised and
satirised of late, that there is no necessity to describe the symptoms
of this class of patient any further. We might add, though, that
in some cases the <i>sequelæ</i> of the complaint aged the subject by ten or
twenty years.</p>

<p>It was distressing to note that even the respected occupants of the
Bench did not invariably escape; but they received the infection in
a mild form. They fairly well managed to retain their dignity and
personality, but they could <i>not</i> remember the names of such common
objects as an "oof-bird," or the meaning of so familiar a term as
"going tommy-dodd." This was inconvenient, as it necessitated the
employment of cockney interpreters.</p>

<p>It was a case of "dunno 'oo they are" with a good many other
individuals and sections of the community.</p>

<p>One reverend gentleman had it badly, and turned litigant on the
spot. Quite oblivious of his sacerdotal functions and character, he
imagined that he would be a public benefactor if he went about
suing unoffending 'busses for obstructing a minute portion of their
window-lights with advertisements and notice-boards. This amused
the public at first, but after a while he was voted a nuisance and a
bore. Then the Salvationists caught the bacillus <i>en bloc</i>. One and
all they thought they were musicians, and, as such, entitled to make
Sunday a Day of Riot.</p>

<p>Amongst other unfortunate specimens of humanity were the shop-lifters,
who fancied they were shop-walkers; the burglars, who
habitually mistook their home address; the quarterly tenants, who,
on the other hand, forgot to remain at home at periodical intervals;
and our old friend <span class="sc">'Arry</span>, who forgot his manners and his h's.</p>

<p>The list of victims might be indefinitely extended. Once it was
thought that they were responsible for their actions; but now,
thanks to the progress of medical science, the <i>amnesia bacillus</i> has
been identified. It only remains for a new <span class="sc">Pasteur</span> to invent some
counteracting microbe.</p>

<h2>CRAZY TALES.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 130px;"><a href="images/193b-260.png"><img src="images/193b-130.png" width="130" height="286" alt="The Duchess of Pomposet" /></a></div>

<p>The Duchess of <span class="sc">Pomposet</span> was writhing, poor thing, on the horns
of a dilemma. Painful position, very. She was the greatest of
great ladies, full of fire and fashion, and with a purple blush (she
was born that colour) flung bangly arms round the neck of her
lord and master. The unfortunate man was a shocking sufferer,
having a bad unearned increment, and enduring
constant pain on account of his back being broader
than his views.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Pomposet</span>," she cried, resolutely. "Duky
darling!"</p>

<p>(When first married she had ventured to apostrophise
him as "ducky," but His Grace thought
it <i>infra dig.</i>, and they compromised by omitting
the vulgar "c.")</p>

<p>"Duky," she said, raising pale distinguished
eyes to a Chippendale mirror, "I have made up
my mind."</p>

<p>"Don't," expostulated the trembling peer.
"You are so rash!"</p>

<p>"What is more, I have made up yours."</p>

<p>"To make up the mind of an English duke,"
he remarked, with dignity, "requires no ordinary
intellect; yet I believe with your feminine hydraulics
you are capable of anything, <span class="sc">Jane</span>."</p>

<p>(That this aristocratic rib of His rib should have been named plain
<span class="sc">Jane</span> was a chronic sorrow.)</p>

<p>"Don't keep me in suspense," he continued; "in fact, to descend
to a colloquialism, I insist on Your Grace letting the cat out of the
bag with the least possible delay."</p>

<p>"As you will," she replied. "Your blood be on your own coronet.
Prepare for a shock&mdash;a revelation. I have fallen! Not once&mdash;but
many times."</p>

<p>"Wretched woman!&mdash;I beg pardon!&mdash;wretched Grande Dame!
call upon <span class="sc">Debrett</span> to cover you!"</p>

<p>"I am madly in love with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By my taffeta and ermine, I swear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, peace!" said <span class="sc">Jane</span>. "Compose yourself, ducky&mdash;that is
<span class="sc">Plantagenet</span>. Forgive the slip. I am agitated. My mind runs
on slips."</p>

<p>The Duke groaned.</p>

<p>"Horrid, awful slips!"</p>

<p>With a countenance of alabaster he tore at his sandy top-knot.</p>

<p>"I have deceived you. I admit it. Stooped to folly."</p>

<p>A supercilious cry rent the air as the Duke staggered on his
patrician limbs.</p>

<p>With womanly impulse&mdash;flinging caste to the winds&mdash;<span class="sc">Jane</span> caught
the majestic form to her palpitating alpaca, and, watering his beloved
features with Duchessy drops, cried in passionate accents, "My
King! My Sensitive Plant! Heavens! It's his unlucky back!
Be calm, <span class="sc">Plantagenet</span>. I have&mdash;been&mdash;learning&mdash;to&mdash;<i>bike!</i> There!
On the sly!"</p>

<p>The Duke flapped a reviving toe, and squeezed the august fingers.</p>

<p>"I am madly enamoured of&mdash;my machine."</p>

<p>The peer smoothed a ruffled top-knot with ineffable grace.</p>

<p>"Likewise am determined <i>you</i> shall take lessons. Now it is no use,
duky. I mean to be tender but firm with you."</p>

<p>The Potentate gave a stertorous chortle, and, stretching out his
arms, fell in a strawberry-leaf swoon on the parquet floor, his ducal
head on the lap of his adored <span class="sc">Jane</span>.</p>

<h3>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Mount the Butter-tub!</span>&mdash;Irish
butter is on its trial, it
seems. It has managed to get
a bad name, because some of
the makers or dealers become
so attached to it they won't
part with it for a month or so
after it is churned&mdash;and when
they <i>do</i> part with it they pretend
it's new. So the trustees
of the Cork butter market
suggest a "date-brand" as a
means of restoring the damaged
reputation of the Hibernian
cow. It is quite obvious that
if butter is to keep, it mustn't
be kept&mdash;which sounds like a
bull, but it's true. Now is
the time for Irish patriots to
come to the rescue of their
firkins&mdash;to form a "Brand
League" if necessary&mdash;and
prevent the produce of Irish
dairies being evicted from the
markets of England.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><span class="sc">Why should Glasgow
Wait?</span>&mdash;The average time
taken by a telegram to get
from Glasgow to London, or
<i>vice versâ</i>, is twenty-nine
minutes, and the cry of the
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce,
in consequence, is
"More wires!" The Chamber
does not mind if they are overhead
wires; all it objects to is,
overdue wires. There has been
a railway race to the north;
but a telegraph race seems
still more wanted just now.
And the worst of it is that the
lordly Stock-Exchange folk
are specially provided with a
wire that sends <i>their</i> telegrams
in five minutes. <i>Punch's</i> advice
to the Chamber of Commerce
is&mdash;"wire in!"</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">Bumbledom and Bristles.</span>&mdash;A
strike of barbers has occurred
at the Cork workhouse;
no inmate cares to undertake
the duty at the pay of one
shilling a week; and the
guardians are thinking of
getting in outdoor relief for
the chins of their paupers.

enormous hotel,
the neighbour and, it may be,
the friendly rival of the Savoy
Hotel <i>à la Carte</i>,&mdash;for friendship
in opposition is possible
though improbable,&mdash;is almost
completed, but apparently
it is still "a deed without
a name." What is it to
be called? The board, not of
directors, but of advertisement
outside, says, "<i>This Magnificent
Hotel</i>," &amp;c., &amp;c. Well,
gentlemen proprietors, why
not take this description as
the title? It does not look bad
in French, "<i>L'Hôtel Magnifique</i>."
And in plain English
"<i>The Magnificent</i>" is a
striking title, which can become
popular as "<i>The Mag.</i>"
<i>Mr. Punch</i>, as General Hotel
Inspector and Universal Board
Adviser, offers the above suggestion.</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">

<p>It is not finished, but snapt off short,</p>

<h3>A CLERICAL MISTAKE.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>Fragment of a Romance found shortly after the
holding of the recent Clerical Meetings.</i>)</p>

<p>"You are most kind," said the guest, getting
down from the dogcart and assisting the
retainer to carry his portmanteau into the
house.</p>

<p>"Not at all," was the reply. "If you are
so good as to wait a moment, I will take the
vehicle round to the stables and then show
you your room."</p>

<p>The guest bowed his head gratefully, and
yet with some embarrassment. Who was this
retainer? He seemed to be a man of education,
and yet&mdash;&mdash; He had no time for further
thought, as the subject of his meditations
returned to him.</p>

<p>"I was as speedy as possible," said he; "as
I knew you would like to dress. The rector
dines rather early, and is sure to be punctual
to-night. This way."</p>

<p>And then the two young men marched up
the staircase, and entered together the spare
room.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed the retainer, as he
finished laying out the contents of the guest's

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The after-deck of an excursion-steamer, which is on its
return to Scarborough from Bridlington, where the excursionists
have employed a shining hour in laying in copious luncheons at
various restaurants and eating-houses. Owing to the tide, they
have had to land and re-embark in small boats through a rather
choppy bit of sea, the consequence being that the majority of the
party&mdash;though not indisposed&mdash;are inclined to prefer meditation
to moving about, probably on the principle of "letting sleeping
dogs lie." After Flamborough Head has been rounded, a young
man in a frock coat and a cloth cap, who has hitherto been
regarded as perfectly inoffensive, suddenly brings out a pair of
plush-covered tables from behind the funnel, and reveals himself
in the unwelcome character of a professional conjuror.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Young Man</i> (<i>clearing his throat and pointedly addressing a
group of torpid tourists on the centre seats</i>). Ladies <i>and</i> gentlemen,
with your very kind permission, I
will now endeavour to amuse you by
exhibiting a few simple feats of
ledger de mang to which I invite
your closest attention (<i>the persons
addressed instantly assume an air
of uneasy abstraction</i>), as I find that
the more carefully my audience
watches my proceedings the less able
they are to detect the manner in
which the trick is performed.... I
'ave 'ere, ladies and gentlemen, a
gingerbeer bottle, just a plain stone
gingerbeer bottle of a pattern no
doubt familiar to you all. (<i>He produces
it, and it appears to be generally
unpopular, as if it called up
reminiscences of revelry which some
would willingly forget.</i>) I will now
pass it around in order that you may
satisfy yourselves that it is what it
appears to be. (<i>To a</i> Somnolent Excursionist
<i>in a corner.</i>) Will you
oblige me, Sir, by kindly taking it
in your 'and?</p>

<p><i>The Somnolent Excursionist</i> (<i>who
seems to be under the impression that
he is being offered refreshment</i>).
Eh? gingerbeer? No, thanky, never
take it.</p>
<p class="rindent">[<i>He closes his eyes again.</i></p>

<p><i>The Y. M.</i> (<i>to a</i> Grumpy Excursionist
<i>on a campstool</i>). Perhaps,
Sir, you will oblige me by examining
this bottle.</p>

<p><i>The Grumpy Excursionist</i> (<i>wrathfully</i>).
Hang it all, Sir, do you suppose
<i>I</i>'m any judge of gingerbeer
bottles; take the beastly thing away!</p>

<p><i>The Y. M.</i> (<i>cast down, but undeterred</i>).
Well, you are all satisfied
that it <i>is</i> an ordinary earthenware
bottle. Now I take this tin case&mdash;made,
as you perceive, in two parts
to fit closely round the bottle. I will
just give you an opportunity of 'andling
the case so that you may convince yourselves of its being perfectly
empty. (<i>He proffers it for inspection, but everybody seems
willing to take it on trust.</i>) I enclose the bottle in the case&mdash;so&mdash;I make
one or two passes&mdash;hey, presto&mdash;and, on opening the case, the bottle
will be found to have vanished. (<i>It has&mdash;but nobody appears to regret
its disappearance.</i>) I close the case, which you all saw to be empty,
once more, and what do I find it contain! (<i>He pulls out yard after
yard of coloured ribbon, which falls absolutely flat, but if the tin
case had emitted a column of smoke and a genuine Arabian djinn, it
would probably fail just now to produce any deep impression.</i>) I
shall next produce a pack of ordinary playing cards, from which I
will ask you, Sir, to be good enough to select a card, without letting
me see it or mentioning which it is (<i>to the</i> Grumpy Excursionist, <i>who
brushes him away irritably as he would a bluebottle</i>). <br />Madam, will
you kindly&mdash;&mdash;? (<i>to the</i> Stout Lady, <i>who turns a shawled shoulder and
feebly requests him "Not to come bothering</i> her"). Perhaps <i>you</i>,
Sir&mdash;&mdash;?
(<i>to a</i> Cadaverous Tourist, <i>who intimates that he "never encourages
cardplaying under any form"</i>). Thank you <i>very</i> much (<i>to a</i>
Rubicund
Tourist, <i>who accepts a card out of sheer good-nature</i>). Now I
shuffle the cards again, cut them, and (<i>exhibiting a court-card with
mild triumph</i>) unless I am mistaken, Sir, <i>this</i> was the card you chose!</p>

<p><i>The Rubicund Tourist.</i> Was it? I dessay, I dessay. I didn't
notice particularly myself.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>Upon this the</i> Young Man <i>recognises that his conjuring fails to
charm, and retires to the funnel in apparent discomfiture.</i></p>

<p><i>Excursionists</i> (<i>to one another</i>). Card-tricks are all very well in
their proper place; but, when you come out for a blow like this,
why.... If it had been a little <i>music</i>, now, or a song, or soomat
o' that soart, it would ha' been nahce enoof.... (<i>With dismay.</i>) Why,
danged if he isn't going to give us anoother turn of it!</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>The</i> Young Man <i>reappears, carrying two dismal old dummies
with battered papier-maché heads, and preternaturally
mobile jaws.</i></p>

<p><i>The Y. M.</i> (<i>after planting these effigies in such a position as to
depress as many as possible</i>). I now 'ave the pleasure of introducing
to your notice two very old friends of mine, Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Jeremiah
Jordles</span>. (<i>The audience, not having energy enough to escape,
submit in sombre resignation to these fresh tormentors, which
goggle at them with cheerful imbecility.</i>) Well, Mrs. <span class="sc">Jordles</span>,
Ma'am, and how do <i>you</i> find yourself this afternoon? I 'ope you're
enjoying this most delightful trip.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>He bends his head deferentially for
the answer, with a sympathetic

<p><i>The Female Figure</i> (<i>with a waggling

most delightful trip, so there. I
believe I'm going to be ill in a
minute. I feel that queer, I do.</p>

<p><i>Female F.</i> Well, <i>you</i> needn't talk,

she'd live to be sorry for it!</p>

<p><i>The Stout Lady</i> (<i>to the</i> Cadaverous

to go on like this. Downright vulgarity
<i>I</i> call it!</p>

<p><i>The Cadaverous Man.</i> You are
right, Mum It's quite enough to
upset anybody. If he's going to
make either of them images purtend
to be unwell, I shall call the Captin
and put a stop to it.</p>

<p><i>The Y. M.</i> (<i>with a tardy perception
that he might have chosen a
more generally agreeable topic, and
meanly throwing the blame upon the
innocent dummies</i>). There, Mr. <span class="sc">Jordles</span>,
Sir, that'll do. We don't care to hear what you and your
good lady took by way of a relish; tell us about something else.</p>

<p><i>Male F.</i> All right. There was a quart o' winkles, as wasn't
over&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Y. M.</i> (<i>shaking</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Jordles</span> <i>up, and stopping his
mouth</i>).
'Ush, Sir, 'ush! Beyave, now, and see if you can set quiet while
Mrs. <span class="sc">Jordles</span> sings us a little song.</p>

<p><i>Male F.</i> What? 'Er sing! 'Ere, chuck me overboard, will

Well, what shall I sing? Oh, I know. (<i>Quavering.</i>) "<i>Where are

<p><i>Male F.</i> Why, in gaol, doing time!</p>

<p class="rindent1">[Mr. Jordles <i>is reproved and corrected as before, but his senile
flippancy only excites general disgust, and when he proceeds
to boast that a beautiful young lady he met in Bridlington
has fallen violently in love with him, the audience clearly
resent the statement as an outrage to their intelligence. The
Ventriloquist perseveres a little longer, though even his own
belief in the dummies seems to be shaken, and at length he
gives them up as hopeless, and carries them off ignominiously,</i>

once more, only to gasp in impotent horror the next
moment, as the irrepressible</i> Young Man <i>returns with a
smaller figure, modelled and dressed to represent an almost
inconceivably repulsive infant. He perches himself on the
bulwark, and placing this doll on his knee, affects to converse
with it, until its precocity and repeated demands for a
cheesecake render it an object of universal loathing and
detestation. However, its pertness suddenly begins to flag,
as beads gather upon the Ventriloquist's pallid brow, and
allowing the figure to collapse in a limp heap, he rises
unsteadily to his feet.</i>

<p><span class="sc">The Poet-Laureate Stakes</span> (<i>by "Our
Special Commissioner"</i>).&mdash;There is not much
to choose between the competitors for the
above unimportant fixture. Ever since the
publication of the weights <i>Sir Edwin Arnold</i>
has held the position of first favourite. He
appears to have derived no harm from his
recent journey to "India"; indeed, on visiting
him at his new quarters in "the Tenth
Mews" we found him in the pink of condition.
Although <i>Mr. Austin</i> has, owing to a
strained cæsura, and consequent restriction to
walking exercise, gone back in the betting,
he is, nevertheless, looked upon in some
quarters as a likely candidate; while <i>Sir
Lewis Morris</i> is very much fancied&mdash;by himself.
A somewhat sensational wager of £3000
to £10 was booked against <i>Sir Lewis</i> and

<h2 class="sans">THE PROBLEM PLAYWRIGHT'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Has the Problem Play a solution?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly; it answers
the purposes of the author and the
manager.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> From this I take it that it is
invariably successful?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well, it is never a failure; or,
rather, hardly ever.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you make your meaning a
little plainer?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If it is not invariably a triumph
of coin, it is a success of esteem. The
house is crowded for a couple of
months.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And after?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The Problem Play is not expected
to have an after.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the essence of such a
creation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The unconventional treatment
of the conventional.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Give an example?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Two men tossing up for a lady.
In <i>Box and Cox</i> the transaction was
conducted with the assistance of a
sixpence in the politest fashion
imaginable; in a later version the
affair could not be arranged without
a pack of cards and much forcible
language.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Was the scene the same in
both, like the situation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, in <i>Box and Cox</i> the spot
was a second-floor back; in the
other, the interior of an observatory
on the summit of a mountain.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you mention any other
characteristic of the Problem Play?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The dramatist should be daring.
People should say of his work that it
would have surprised their parents
and startled their grandmothers
into fits.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How can this desirable end be
attained?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By the playwright causing his
heroine to throw a pocket-bible into
the fire, or perform some other act of
parallel eccentricity.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Should the heroine have any
peculiarity?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> As a rule she should be a
woman with a past.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But has not this type been
worked to death?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It has certainly seen much
service, to that the newest kind of
heroine is to be preferred.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the newest kind of
heroine?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The woman who, without having
a past, has, under the influence of
drink, seriously damaged the possibility
of enjoying a future.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When does the leading situation
arrive?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> At the end of the second act.
What goes before and comes after
that climax is, to a large extent, immaterial.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the customary fate of
the heroine after the leading situation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> On rare occasions, suicide "off."
But the usual exit is a retreat in rear
of the clergy.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the customary effect of
the Problem Play?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That for a considerably longer
time than nine days it is a wonder.
Every one talks about it, and many
see it during that period. When the
wonder is exhausted according to
precedent the cause of the amazement
is forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And, when this last season
arrives, what does the author do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A dramatist, having written
one Problem Play, usually writes
another.</p>

<h2>A ROMANCE OF THE FUTURE.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Chapter I.</span></h4>

<p>The great reform had been effected. Thanks to the Matrimonial
Tripos Act, passed a few years previously, it was no longer left to
blind chance to decide what women should receive the privileges of
matrimony. All those who aspired to them had to enter for the
Tripos held once a year under the supervision of the State, and to
pass a rigorous examination in Household Arithmetic, Domestic
Economy, Etiquette, and other subjects. Only those who obtained a
first class were allowed to marry noblemen or millionaires, those who
got a second might mate with a peer's younger son or a baronet,
while those hapless ones who failed to get a third were absolutely
prohibited from matrimony, although occasionally one or two who
narrowly missed taking honours were allowed a detrimental by the
examiners. And no maiden was permitted to enter for the examination
more than three times in all.</p>

<p>It was the knowledge of this last fact which cast a shade of troubled
anxiety upon the faces of <span class="sc">Strephon Smith</span> and <span class="sc">Amaryllis Jones</span>
as they paced up and down the garden on the eve of the annual
examination. Their engagement had been a long one, for twice had
<span class="sc">Amaryllis</span> entered for the Tripos, and twice had been hopelessly
ploughed. Should she fail once more on the morrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, my <span class="sc">Amaryllis</span>," cried the faithful <span class="sc">Strephon</span>, "look not
so downcast. Failure? it is impossible! Have not I coached you
carefully in all the subjects? Come, repeat once more, to give you
confidence, the formulæ of poultry-rearing."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Amaryllis</span> smiled sadly. "It is unnecessary," she replied; "I
remember them well. And yet my mind misgives me. Should that
hateful <span class="sc">Meliboeus Brown</span> foil us once again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak not his name!" exclaimed <span class="sc">Strephon</span>, grinding his teeth.
"True that he has vowed that we shall never marry; true that at
your first attempt, under the mask of friendship, he inscribed all the
wrong dates upon your dainty cuff, while on the next occasion he
bribed the candidates sitting next to you to jog your elbow and to
upset the ink over your papers; but on this occasion he will be
powerless. With the knowledge which, thanks to my assiduous
coaching, you now possess, you are certain to pass. A month hence,
my <span class="sc">Amaryllis</span>, and we shall be wedded."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Amaryllis</span> flung herself into his arms. "If only I am not ploughed!
But, darling <span class="sc">Strephon</span>, I have a request to make of you. I implore
you to sit in the gallery to-morrow throughout the examination, and
so, looking up to your face, I shall gain fresh courage."</p>

<p>"Sweet, I will do so," cried <span class="sc">Strephon</span>. "And&mdash;you know the
deaf-and-dumb alphabet, I think? If so, and an answer has slipped
your memory, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," said <span class="sc">Amaryllis</span>, firmly. "'Tis unnecessary. And we
must run no risks."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4><span class="sc">Chapter II.</span></h4>

<p>The great examination had begun. Ranged at the long rows of
tables sat the fairest of England's maidenhood; some conning the
paper with painful perplexity, while others scribbled down the
answers with feverish haste, or gazed imploringly up to the gallery
whence their anxious lovers regarded them. Amongst these was
plainly visible the heroic form of <span class="sc">Strephon Smith</span>.</p>

<p>Seated on a daïs at the end of the room was Professor <span class="sc">Plumboss</span>,
the chief examiner, the same who had ploughed no fewer than 5428
candidates at the last examination. Perhaps it was the effect of
the constant terror of assassination in which he lived, but on this
particular morning the Professor seemed ill-at-ease. Ever and anon
he pressed his hand firmly on his head, as if he wished to retain a wig
in its place; now and then he fumbled mysteriously with his beard.
Could it be a false one?</p>

<p>But <span class="sc">Amaryllis</span> had no leisure to observe such trifles. With unfaltering
pen she dashed off the answers to all the questions without
a moment's hesitation, and she had finished a good half-hour before
the appointed time. With all her wondrous grace of movement she
tripped lightly up the room, and handed over her papers to the
Professor. Surely there was an ill-disguised twinkle of elation in
his eyes as he took them. And then, when <span class="sc">Amaryllis</span> had left, with
her papers in his hand, he edged nearer and nearer to the fire-place.
As if by accident, he prepared to drop them into the flames.</p>

<p>Little had he recked that the eagle eye of <span class="sc">Strephon Smith</span> was
upon him. With a single bound that intrepid hero leaped from the
gallery to the floor, rushed upon the Professor, with one resolute
sweep of his hand knocked off his wig, spectacles and false beard,
and disclosed the pale and trembling features of his hated rival,
<span class="sc">Meliboeus Brown</span>!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4><span class="sc">Chapter III.</span></h4>

<p>And so the plot was discovered just in time. The nefarious
<span class="sc">Brown</span> had kidnapped the Professor on his way to the hall, had
stolen his robes, and disguised himself so as to play the part of the
examiner himself. Another minute, and his wicked plan would have
succeeded, <span class="sc">Amaryllis's</span> papers would have been burnt, and she and
<span class="sc">Strephon</span> would have been separated for ever. Thanks to the
latter's courageous action, the impostor had been detected, and was
subsequently sentenced to several years' imprisonment.</p>

<p>When the real Professor had been liberated and came to look over
<span class="sc">Amaryllis's</span> work, a slight difficulty arose. The law insisted that
one who had answered with such perfect correctness must marry a
peer, while <span class="sc">Strephon</span> was but a humble commoner. However, a
grateful nation rescued him from this dilemma by awarding him a
dukedom.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>A strange report reaches me, a rumour which (if such a course
may be predicated of a mere report) opens up illimitable vistas.
The dramatic critics, it would appear, have been for some time past
in a state of dissatisfaction. A newspaper proprietor has been turned
into a peer; editors in profusion have journeyed down to Windsor as
very plain misters, and, having been tapped upon the shoulder with
cold steel, have returned to the bosoms of their families as knights; a
novelist, a mere teller of stories, has undergone the same process, not,
it is well understood, for his own glory, but for the greater honour
of Literature (capital L please); and, worst of all, an actor has survived
the blood-curdling ceremony of the <i>accolade</i>, and has received
the congratulations and gifts of other members of his profession.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Quæ cum ita sint</i>, the dramatic critics have been very naturally
asking one another why they alone should toil and moil (the "midnight
oil" irresistibly suggests itself as a pleasing and perfectly
appropriate rhyme) without any recognition beyond the vulgar one
of a money-payment, sufficient, no doubt, to keep them in bread and
beer, ties, clothes, collars, and cuffs, but utterly inadequate when
considered as a reward for the services they perform on behalf of Art
and the Drama. One thing led to another (it generally does); there
were conversations, interchanges of ideas, meetings, and so forth;
and eventually matters came to a head in the formation of a society,
the members of which pledged themselves to promote by all legitimate
means the claims of dramatic critics to knighthoods, baronetcies,
privy-councillorships, peerages, and other rewards.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The final meeting, at which the rules were discussed and passed,
and the officials appointed, began harmoniously enough. Mr.
<span class="sc">Clement Scott</span>, proposed by Mr. <span class="sc">Archer</span>, and seconded by Mr.
<span class="sc">A.
B. Walkley</span>, was unanimously voted to the Chair. His opening
speech was marked by great fervour. For years, he said, dramatic
critics had been engaged in the thankless task of educating the
public taste, and of instructing dramatic authors in the true principles
of the construction of stage-plays. At last, thank heaven,
they were beginning to be appreciated at their proper value. Their
names were becoming household words. The average reader, when
he opened his <i>World</i>, turned first to the article signed "W. A."
The same, or a similar person, rushed breathlessly through <i>The
Speaker</i> until he was arrested by the magic initials "A. B. W."
At this point Mr. <span class="sc">Archer</span> intervened with the remark that for
himself, he might say there was only one article, the dramatic,
in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> that absolutely fascinated him; and
Mr. <span class="sc">Walkley</span>, rising immediately afterwards, observed that, having
studied the essays of <span class="sc">M. Lemaître</span>, he had no hesitation in saying
that the pungent critiques of the <i>Telegraph</i> were equalled, he would
not say surpassed, by the masterly <i>aperçus</i> of stage-craft to be found
in <i>Truth</i> and the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Clement
Scott</span>
was visibly affected, and having with difficulty mastered his emotion,
proceeded to shake both his colleagues by the hand, and in a
voice broken with sobs thanked them for their tributes. He himself,
he added, had endeavoured to make the stalls and the dress circle fit
places for the flower of English maidenhood, for those beautiful,
blushing British girls who were at once the joy of their families and
the pride of our race. He then called upon all the members present
to state what titles they preferred, intimating that, by the express
desire of the committee, he himself was willing to become a Duke.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Archer</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Walkley</span> having declared their preference
for Marquisates, Mr. <span class="sc">Moy Thomas</span> said that an Earldom would
satisfy his modest needs. Mr. <span class="sc">Bendall</span> thought Viscount sounded
attractive, and chose that title; while Mr. <span class="sc">A. E. T. Watson</span> intimated
that all he wanted was to be a Baron&mdash;Baron <span class="sc">Badminton of
Beaufort</span>. Mr. <span class="sc">Bernard Shaw</span> stood by his life-long principles,
and declined everything except a Privy-Councillorship. Various
other gentlemen having spoken, and a complete list of titles having
been arranged, the meeting was about to adjourn, when Mr. <span class="sc">Clement
Scott</span> rose again to make a few parting observations.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"My Lords," he began amidst deafening applause, "it only
remains for me to state briefly the principles by which we shall
be guided. We shall not truckle to the nauseating rubbish
purveyed by any Norwegian charlatan." What else he would have
said must for ever remain a matter of guess-work, for at this point
he was immediately set upon by Lord <span class="sc">Archer</span>, and torn forcibly
from his chair. Baron <span class="sc">Badminton</span>, however, gallantly came to His
Grace's assistance, and a scene of indescribable confusion ensued.
Strawberry leaves were torn to tatters, and several handsome property
coronets were ruthlessly trampled under foot. Order was, however,
at last restored by the arrival of Sir <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span> with a strong
force of dramatic authors armed with problem-plays. In the conflict
that followed many heads were broken, but eventually the hall was
cleared. It is understood that, notwithstanding this deplorable
incident, the agitation is to be vigorously pursued. I shall publish
any further information that may reach me.</p>

<h2>SIR E. CLARKE AND THE BAR&mdash;AN EXPLANATION.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/203-750.png"><img src="images/203-200.png" width="200" height="355" alt="A. Briefless, Jun." /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;The paper you edit with so much advantage to the public
is the recognised organ of the legal profession. This being so, I
appeal to you on behalf of the Bar. Sir, it will not have escaped
your attention that on a recent occasion Sir <span class="sc">Edward Clarke</span>, in
returning thanks for his colleagues of the Law List, referred to the
custom observed by some counsel of accepting briefs indiscriminately.
The ex-Solicitor-General (shortly, I trust, to become "Mr. Attorney",)
related an anecdote concerning the last of the Barons&mdash;Mr. Baron
<span class="sc">Huddlestone</span>&mdash;to the following effect. You
will remember that Sir <span class="sc">Edward</span>, when
only a stuff-gownsman, was "with" the eminent Bencher
of Gray's Inn in a case. "I trust, Mr. <span class="sc">Clarke</span>," said
the coming Baron's assistant to the then promising Junior,
"that you will be able to attend to it if Mr. <span class="sc">Huddlestone</span>
fails to put in an appearance." "I suppose," replied
the future Sir <span class="sc">Edward</span>, "that Mr. <span class="sc">Huddlestone</span>
is not coming." "Well, he <i>may</i> be away," was
the reply, "because to-day he has briefs in thirteen other
actions." Then Sir <span class="sc">Edward</span> wittily explained
that the fault lay with the public. Suitors could
select their own advocates, and there were plenty of men practising
at the Bar who would gladly accept a brief, for a very moderate fee,
should the services of a better-known colleague be retained in some
other matter. Mr. ex-Solicitor is perfectly right. There are such
men. For instance, I myself, should Sir <span class="sc">Edward</span> wish it, would
willingly assist him. If he has an overflow of pink-tape tied parcels,
let him send them to me, and I will give them my best attention.
I shall be delighted to pick up, so to speak, the documentary crumbs
that fall from his brief-encumbered table. But that is a matter
which chiefly concerns Sir <span class="sc">Edward</span> and myself. It is not entirely
with a view to making the above suggestion that I address you. No,
Sir, I have other than personal interests at heart.</p>

<p>I am convinced that, although every counsel has the right to be
"retained" in every case, but a comparative few exercise the
privilege. I have known the late Serjeant <span class="sc">Parry</span> (with whom I
have had the honour to act&mdash;while taking a note in the temporary
absence of a learned friend&mdash;on more than one occasion) return his
brief, with its accompanying honorarium, when unable to attend to
the former, and thus earn the latter. Speaking for myself, I made
it a rule, shortly after I was called, never to "devil" in two places
at once. But to come to the point. As a matter of fact&mdash;and a grain
of true testimony is better than a ton of theory&mdash;I can deliberately
declare that, during a long forensic experience, extending over
several decades, I have never had two cases on the same day. And
what has been my experience no doubt has been the experience of
many others. I would not for worlds have it thought that I neglect my
duty because I have a plethora of professional work. And here I must
stop, as I have to give my most careful attention to a consent brief,
which appears to me to bristle with technical difficulties. However,
as I am desired to acquiesce, I shall no doubt carry out my client's
instructions with the customary formalities.</p>

<h2 class="sans">HOW KIPPER SLEW THE NEW FOREST HORNET.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Chapter I.</span>&mdash;<i>The Recluse.</i></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little goblin called <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, who
lived the life of a hermit in a hollow oak-tree in the New Forest.
He never made merry with the elves, and had a positive dislike to
fairies; and, if any of them presumed to address him, he would curl
himself into a ball like a hedgehog, and refuse to straighten himself
until he was left alone again. Various rumours were current in
Fairyland as to the reason of <span class="sc">Kipper's</span> moroseness. Some said that
he had been robbed by an unscrupulous brother of a valuable iron
mine, situated under Hengistbury
Head; others, that he had been
crossed in love; while there was
a third party in Fairydom which
stoutly maintained that he had
been expelled from Goblinland on
account of his desire to upset the
king and queen, and establish a
republic. Be that as it may,
<span class="sc">Kipper</span> was no favourite in the
country of his exile. Not that he
need have been unsociable, for,
when he first arrived, the greatest
attention was paid to him by his
neighbours. The most important
personages in Fairydom called upon
him, he received invitations to the
Court balls, and he was bidden to
several jolly bachelor parties given
by the elves on the sward which
surrounds Rufus's Stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;"><a href="images/204-900.png"><img src="images/204-460.png" width="460" height="456" alt="'He thought nothing of taking a clump of dock leaves.'" /></a>
<p class="center">"He thought nothing of taking a clump of dock leaves."</p></div>

<p>But <span class="sc">Kipper</span> made no response to
these advances. He showed that
he meant to be unsociable, and,
little by little, the notabilities and
landed gentry ceased to take any
notice of him. Occasionally some
of the sportsmen of The Court, when
out hunting the slow-worms and the
bumble-bees, would come across
<span class="sc">Kipper</span>, mounted on a huge and
vicious looking stagbeetle, which
he managed with considerable address, but he never deigned to
respond to their salutations, but passed on his way with a malevolent
grin. Even the forest pigs and ponies took a dread of him at last,
and would scamper away through the bracken directly they saw him
approach. As to the deer, the pheasants, the rabbits, and the hares,
they would just as soon have faced a poacher. It will be seen,
therefore, that <span class="sc">Kipper</span> was not the sort of person to whom an elf or
a fairy would appeal in case of distress. If he had a heart at all, it
was like that of an artichoke, all choke&mdash;and very little arti. As far
as human beings went, <span class="sc">Kipper</span> had a lofty disdain for them and
their ways. He smiled contemptuously when the stagbeetle told
him how the elves had stolen this cottager's milk, or robbed that
verderer's garden of its gooseberries. And his sarcasm was equally
pronounced when he heard how a fairy orchestra had serenaded the
parson's pretty daughter on Midsummer Eve, or that some good-natured
fays had collected the swarming bees of a hard-working
farmer, and driven them home against the wishes of their queen.
<span class="sc">Kipper</span> looked upon men, women, and children as wretched beings,
who worried themselves without any necessity&mdash;poor creatures, whose
only object in life appeared to be to endeavour to make one another
miserable, and discontented with their very existence. Therefore he
regarded them no more than he would newts and lizards. Indeed,
he often told the stagbeetle that he had far more respect for a newt,
because he could develop an orange waistcoat, whereas a man could
not keep his chest warm without robbing another animal of its skin
or wool. As to the lizards, they
only came out when they could
bask in the sun; whereas a man
had to pick up and kindle sticks to
keep his ugly body warm, and cook
his poisonous food.</p>

<p>Now if <span class="sc">Kipper</span> could be said to
enjoy anything, it was the leaping
of big obstacles when mounted
on the stagbeetle. He thought
nothing of taking a clump of dock
leaves, or of flying or sailing over a
thick bush of prickly gorze. It
cannot be said that the stagbeetle
enjoyed the jumping as much as
his master did; but inasmuch as
the gnome had broken him in at
an early age, and never rode without
a pair of stout hawthorn pricks
on his heels and a bramble switch
in his hand, the coal-black steed
had to make the best of a bad
job. One fine day, however, when
<span class="sc">Kipper</span> had partaken somewhat
too freely of some fine wild honey,
which he had found in an old oak,
an accident occurred to the reckless,
rash rider. On his way home he
had to pass by Stoney Cross, and
it so happened that the road was
being mended, and a huge heap
of granite lay by the wayside.
Nothing would satisfy <span class="sc">Kipper</span> but that he must leap this mound,
and so he told the stagbeetle to put forth all his strength. The poor
creature besought his master not to risk both their lives, but <span class="sc">Kipper</span>
was as hard as a pond after a six weeks frost. Gathering his rush-reins
in his hands, and ramming the hawthorn pricks into the sides of
the stagbeetle, he cried, "Hi! over," and went for the granite.
The stagbeetle did his best, but just before he made his effort he
faltered in his stride. The next moment he was kicking out with his
hind legs, and his horns were sticking between two great stones on
the top of the hard hillock; while a yard on the other side, among
the moss and wild thyme, there was lying quite still the body of the
luckless <span class="sc">Kipper</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our Booking-Office.</span>&mdash;"<i>Boconnoc.</i>"
What a name! It is a "Romance of Wild
Oatcake." It might almost be of Mild Oatcake.
It is the story of an unprincipled boy,
a flighty young married woman, and a sottish
husband. The first third of the book is somewhat
interesting, and pleasantly written. The
second third is dull; and the last revives the
reader's interest just a bit. But, on the
whole, to quote <i>Sir Charles Coldstream</i>, in
<i>Used Up</i>, "There's nothing in it." It is
disappointing to those who expect much more
than this from the author.&mdash;<span class="sc">B. de B.-W.</span></p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>The school-boy of to-day&mdash;what, after all,
is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?&mdash;is no
longer to <i>waste</i> his time in poring over the
musty classics! "He is to take an intelligent
interest in other subjects than the dead
languages," says <i>Truth</i>, which proceeds to
give "as well worthy of being held up as a
model for imitation elsewhere," the contents
of an <i>up-to-date</i> examination paper, upon
current events, recently set at Rugby school.
This modern move is, doubtless, an excellent
thing, but one which may be carried too far;
and it would, we venture to think, be a pity
if schools were to be, in the words of <i>Mercutio</i>,
"too much afflicted with these new
tuners of accents, who stand so much on the
<i>new form</i> that they cannot sit at ease <i>on the
old bench</i>." What if <span class="sc">Pinero</span> and <span class="sc">Zangwill</span>
were substituted for <span class="sc">Plato</span> and <span class="sc">Xenophon</span>?</p>

obtaining the colossal amount claimed, he
might then say, with <span class="sc">Horace</span>, "<i>Exegi

<p>"<span class="sc">Unpleasant Little Incident.</span>"&mdash;So the
<i>P. M. G.</i> styled it. As the German <span class="sc">Emperor</span>
and <span class="sc">Empress</span> were passing through Metz,
somebody, from a café window, shouted,
"<i>Vive la France!</i>" Several arrests were of
course made, but apparently nothing more
was heard of the <i>Vox et præterea nil</i>. This
recalls a similar incident that occurred during
the trial of <i>Bardell</i> v. <i>Pickwick</i>, "Put it
down a 'we,' my Lord!" a voice in the gallery
exclaimed, aloud. Search was made. Nobody.
"If you could have pointed him out," said
little <i>Mr. Justice Stareleigh</i> to <i>Sam Weller</i>,
"I would have committed him instantly."
Whereat "<i>Sam</i> bowed his acknowledgments,"
and the incident ended.</p>

many Foyers, and only fell down once. This
was at the Théâtre Français, where the Foyer
is kept highly polished, or used to be so. If
the Foyers are carpeted or matted, there need
be no "Falls."</p>
